# SolvencyProof
Private proof that assets exceed liabilities using zero-knowledge on Ethereum
SolvencyProof
Private proof that assets exceed liabilities using zero-knowledge on Ethereum
SolvencyProof is a privacy-first system that enables exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and financial protocols to cryptographically prove they are solvent—meaning total reserves exceed total liabilities—without revealing balances, users, or transaction data.
The project combines public onchain reserve verification with private liabilities commitments and a zero-knowledge solvency proof verified on Ethereum (Base Sepolia).

Why SolvencyProof
Blockchains are transparent by default. Anyone can see wallet balances, yet financial platforms still struggle to prove solvency without exposing sensitive customer and internal financial data.
SolvencyProof solves this by enabling:
Public verification of solvency
Private customer balances
No trust in centralized attestations
Onchain cryptographic guarantees

What It Proves
At a given snapshot (epoch), SolvencyProof proves:
Σ(total reserves) ≥ Σ(total liabilities)
This statement is verified using a zero-knowledge proof, ensuring that:
Assets are publicly verifiable onchain
Liabilities remain private
Individual users can privately verify inclusion

Architecture Overview
Assets / Reserves
Computed from publicly verifiable onchain reserve wallets
Anyone can independently recompute totals
Liabilities
Ingested offchain (CSV for demo purposes)
Committed to a Merkle tree
Individual users receive private inclusion proofs
Zero-Knowledge Proof
A Circom circuit proves reserves ≥ liabilities
No balances or identities are revealed
Proof is verified onchain via Solidity verifier
Onchain Verification
Solidity verifier contract deployed on Base Sepolia
Emits an onchain solvency attestation event
Frontend UI
Admin flow to publish solvency proofs
User flow to privately verify inclusion
Public dashboard to verify solvency onchain

Tech Stack
Blockchain: Ethereum (Base Sepolia)
Smart Contracts: Solidity
Zero-Knowledge: Circom + snarkjs (Groth16)
Backend: Node.js / TypeScript
Frontend: Next.js + wagmi / viem
Merkle Trees: Poseidon or Keccak hashing
Wallets: EVM-compatible wallets (MetaMask, etc.)

Threat Model & Limitations
SolvencyProof does prove:
Cryptographic solvency at a point in time
Public ownership of reserve assets
User-verifiable inclusion in liabilities
Privacy of balances and identities
SolvencyProof does NOT prove:
Future solvency (proofs are point-in-time)
Completeness of undisclosed or off-ledger liabilities
Liquidity or immediate withdrawability
Absence of fraud or collusion
This system improves verifiability and privacy but does not replace audits, governance, or regulation.

How to Run (High-Level)

# install dependencies
pnpm install

# build liabilities merkle tree
pnpm run build:liabilities

# scan onchain reserves (Base Sepolia)
pnpm run scan:reserves

# generate zk solvency proof
pnpm run prove:solvency

# deploy contracts
pnpm run deploy

# start frontend
pnpm run dev
See /scripts and /backend for detailed commands.
